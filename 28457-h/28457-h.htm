<h2>Rules and Explanation of Terms.</h2>

<div><span class='pagenum' style="text-indent: -2em;"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></div>

<p class="noin">The following Designs are formed by a very simple combination of
Tatting and Crochet, the more elaborate style of both Works being
avoided, so that any Lady with a knowledge of the first rules of each
Art will be able to accomplish the patterns without the least
difficulty, the Stars and Diamonds being made in Tatting and
afterwards worked round with loops of chain Crochet.</p>

<p class="noin">The numerous purposes to which the work can be applied far exceed the
limits of this Book, as it admits of being made in every material. The
Stars have a good effect for spotting and trimming Dresses, and, when
worked in black or white Silk, are suitable for Cloak and Bonnet
Trimmings. For Antimacassars and Doyleys, white and colored Cotton can
be substituted for the Gold and Wool; most of the Designs are adapted
for Church Needlework.</p>

<p class="noin">The Gold Tatting Twine can be obtained in two qualities; the least
expensive should be used for Doyleys and Antimacassars, but for Church
Needlework, or Collars and Sleeves, the better make is most suited.</p>

<p class="noin">The new Tatting Silk is a substitute for the Gold, and is made in two
sizes, No. 1 being the coarser.</p>

<p class="noin">In these Designs the knots should be made on the right side of the
work, the reverse side having the best effect.</p>

<div><span class='pagenum' style="text-indent: -2em;"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></div>

<p>"To Commence," in Crochet&mdash;Put the needle into a stitch or pearl loop,
and, leaving an end, bring the wool through in a loop.</p>

<p>"To Join," in Crochet&mdash;Take the needle out of the loop, put it into
the stitch to be joined, and bring the loop through this stitch,
always joining to the centre of a loop of chain.</p>



<hr />
<h2>TATTING.</h2>

<p>THE STARS AND DIAMONDS.</p>

<p>For which a Shuttle and Ring and Pin will be required. The Shuttle is
to be filled with the materials as directed.</p>

<p>"A Pearl Loop," in Tatting&mdash;Turn the thread which forms the foundation
loop over the pin and continue the stitches.</p>

<p>"A Double Stitch," in Tatting&mdash;Is formed by a single and a reverse
stitch worked alternately.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Octagon Star</span>&mdash;Commence a loop, work 1 double stitch, then (1 pearl and
2 double stitches alternately 7 times), 1 pearl, 1 double, draw the
loop quite close, place the two ends together, knot them firmly and
cut off the ends; it is better to knot the gold twice to make it very
secure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sexagon Star</span>&mdash;Commence a loop, work 1 double, then (1 pearl and 2
double 5 times), 1 pearl, 1 double; draw close &amp;c. as for the previous
Star.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Diamond</span> 1st Oval&mdash;Commence a loop, work 4 double stitches, then 1
pearl, 2 double, 1 pearl, 2 double, 1 pearl, 4 double; draw quite
close, and work 3 Ovals more the same, commencing them close to the
last; and to fasten off firmly, pass the first end through the last
oval, and then through the other three; knot the two ends together.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>
